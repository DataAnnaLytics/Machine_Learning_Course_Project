# Wearable Accelerometer Data


## Intro
Task: see course project instructions <https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning/supplement/PvInj/course-project-instructions-read-first>

## Summary

My laptop is way to slow for Random Forests, so I sticked to SVM which was also quite good.

## Data

### Getting familiar

First I had a look at the data (links were provided in the instructions) and tried to find some info or documentation to find out more about the columns (I was not very successfull) <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/public/papers/2013.Velloso.QAR-WLE.pdf>.


```{r, include=FALSE}
#get some packages
library(gbm)
library(forecast)
library(e1071)
library(caret)

#load data
training_raw=read.csv('pml-training.csv')
testing_raw=read.csv('pml-testing.csv')

#have a first look - not printed
summary(training_raw)
str(training_raw)
View(training_raw)
View(testing_raw)
```

### Preprocessing

I can see that there are a lot of NAs, I'm going to exclude those columns as they do not really help. I'll also exclude some of the first columns like the 'new_window' column. I guess I'll keep the name though - maybe the participants have a very different stature/fitness level/size so it would make sense that e.g. the acceleration is very variable, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the slower participant does it wrong.   

```{r}
#kick out NAs: find NA columns in test set:
not_NA_columns<-colnames(testing_raw[colSums(is.na(testing_raw))==0])
#also delete the first seven columns (apart from the user name)
relevant_colnames<-not_NA_columns[c(-1, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7)]
#apply to test set
testing<-testing_raw[relevant_colnames]
#in the training set there is the additional column 'classe' but no column 'Problem ID'
relevant_colnames[54]<-c('classe')
training_all<-training_raw[relevant_colnames]

```

### Validation set

As the Classe info is not available in the test set, I need an additional validation set so that I can evaluate my models

```{r}
#split training data into smaller training data and validation data
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=training_all$classe, p=0.8, list=FALSE)
training<-training_all[inTrain,]
validating<-training_all[-inTrain,]
```


## Model Selection and validation

We will check rf, rpart, svm, gbm and lda.

### Random forest

I cancelled that after 30min.
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('notime.png')
```

### Trees

```{r}
#model
mod_rpart<-train(classe~.,training, method='rpart')
#predict
pred_rpart<-predict(mod_rpart, validating)
#check accuracy via confusion$class matrix
confusionMatrix(validating$classe, pred_rpart)$overall
```

50%, that's lousy. 

### SVM
```{r}
#model
mod_svm<-svm(classe~.,data=training)
```
```{r}
#predict
pred_svm<-predict(mod_svm, validating)
#check accuracy 
nrow(validating[validating$classe==pred_svm,])/nrow(validating)
```

94%, much better! 

A little more detailed: 
```{r}
#Confusion matrix
table(pred_svm, validating$classe)
```


### gbm

Also quite slow...let's skip that. 

### linear discriminant analysis

```{r}
#model
mod_lda<-train(classe~.,training, method='lda')
#predict
pred_lda<-predict(mod_lda, validating)
#check accuracy via confusion$class matrix
confusionMatrix(validating$classe, pred_lda)$overall
```

73% - nah.

I'll go with SVM! (Although I'd prefer Random Forests. I could do some more checks here like reducing the amount of data, but I don't think I would learn very much doing that)
 
## Test set and quiz results

Let's see what I'll tick in the quiz...

```{r}
predict(mod_svm, testing)
```
How exiting...94% accuracy is not nearly as much as others achieved with random forests...

Yeeah 100%! 

Oh, I haven't used the five figures I was allowed to show you...Here is a pie chart: 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('pie.png')

```


Have a nice day!
